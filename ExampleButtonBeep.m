This example demonstrates the use of the Create2's  buttons.
When in Full or Safe Mode, these buttons may be read as a digital inputs.
The function ButtonSensorRoomba returns 1 for depressed and 0 for not
depressed.

The BeepRoomba function causes the Roomba to beep once. Note: Calling this
function in quick succession will likely result in a single beep. A pause
is necessary for multiple beeps.

In this example pressing the Create's buttons causes the following effects.
* Day - Beep Once
* Minute -    Beep Twice
* Both -    Beep Three Times

Note: There seems to be an issue with the schedule and clock buttons.
Note: Set Serial Port to port connected to Create
