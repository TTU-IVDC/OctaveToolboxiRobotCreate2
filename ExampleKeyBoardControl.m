This example demonstrates keyboard control of the iRobot Create.

Note: Unlike other functions, RobotHardKeyBoard input should be the COM
port you are using, not the declared serial object.

Note: Exiting keyboard control by any method other than pressing 'q' (e.g.
clicking the red x on the window) likely crash MATLAB.
